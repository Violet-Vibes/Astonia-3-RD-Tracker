# Astonia 3 RD Tracker for Astonia Reborn/Steamborn


Originally from http://users.telenet.be/smoorke/astonia/RDTracker/

Updated to work with the steam release of Astonia Reborn by Violet Vibes/Scream

Any client update might and most likely WILL break this, which requires a update to key under settings. 

If you are handy with a memory editor/viewer you can easily find this value out by yourself, otherwise make a issue here/pm me ingame/on discord.

Eventually Teg will make a minimap into the game which will essentially work like this, making this project obsolete but till then it's here.

Current key is 4607008

Download Visual Basic Community edition, open RDTracker.sln, make any changes and then save + compile the source yourself, otherwise there's a compiled version under [release](https://github.com/Violet-Vibes/Astonia-3-RD-Tracker-for-Astonia-Reborn-Steamborn/releases/download/0.2/RDTracker.exe)
